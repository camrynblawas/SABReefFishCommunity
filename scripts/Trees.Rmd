#Get clean data
```{r}
fishdf <- read.csv(here("data", "processeddata", "RFS_AbundanceBiomassDepth.csv"))
fishdf$date <- as.Date(fishdf$date)
```

We are interested in how the reef fish community has changed over time and want to build a tree based model of what environmental factors drive distributions of fishes

Variables we could include: 
 - Location (Lat/Long)
 - Date
 - Family
 - Length
 - Weight
 - Sex
 - Maturity
 - Depth
 - Temperature (surface/bottom)
 - Salinity (surface/bottom)
 - Dissolved Oxygen (surface/bottom)
